# SRTT_TranslationTools
Tools for **partial** translation of the game Saints Row: The Third (UI + Subtitles).

### Why partial?

Because there is a compressed file in the **packfiles** folder called **voices.vpp_pc** and it contains other compressed **.bnk_pc** files with part of the game captions in **.dmav** format, ThomasJepp's tools failed to extract the .bnk_pc files.

# Description
The base language is English to start translating.

The scripts are very rudimentary, but they automate the work of creating a new locale and compressing the translated files into a **.le_strings** file. Be careful as they have few error checks.

Follow the instructions in the scripts and you will be fine.
